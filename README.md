Task 1
🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe with AI (Minimax Algorithm)

An interactive browser-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, featuring a basic AI opponent powered by the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.

🧠 Features:

    ✅ Play as X against an unbeatable AI (O)

    ♟️ AI uses the Minimax algorithm for optimal moves

    💡 Alpha-beta pruning improves performance and reduces computation

    🎨 Responsive UI with a smooth, modern design and hover effects

    🔁 Option to restart the game and play again

This project is great for beginners and intermediate developers to understand game logic, DOM manipulation, and how basic AI decision-making works using recursion and optimization techniques.


Task 2
💬 Simple Rule-Based Chatbot

A browser-based, interactive chatbot built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. This chatbot uses simple rule-based logic (if-else conditions and keyword matching) to simulate conversation with the user—no libraries, APIs, or machine learning involved.

🔧 Features:

    👋 Welcomes the user with a waving robot animation

    🤖 Lets users assign a name to the bot, which it remembers during the session

    🧠 Responds to basic questions like name, origin, purpose, and mood

    😂 Tells light-hearted jokes and reacts to feedback

    📚 Provides fallback responses for unknown queries

This project is ideal for beginners looking to understand chatbot logic, event handling, DOM manipulation, and basic animations in web development.
