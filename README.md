Task 1
🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe with AI (Minimax Algorithm)

An interactive browser-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, featuring a basic AI opponent powered by the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.
🧠 Features:

    ✅ Play as X against an unbeatable AI (O)

    ♟️ AI uses the Minimax algorithm for optimal moves

    💡 Alpha-beta pruning improves performance and reduces computation

    🎨 Responsive UI with a smooth, modern design and hover effects

    🔁 Option to restart the game and play again

This project is great for beginners and intermediate developers to understand game logic, DOM manipulation, and how basic AI decision-making works using recursion and optimization techniques.


Task 2
💬 Simple Rule-Based Chatbot

A browser-based, interactive chatbot built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. This chatbot uses simple rule-based logic (if-else conditions and keyword matching) to simulate conversation with the user—no libraries, APIs, or machine learning involved.
🔧 Features:

    👋 Welcomes the user with a waving robot animation

    🤖 Lets users assign a name to the bot, which it remembers during the session

    🧠 Responds to basic questions like name, origin, purpose, and mood

    😂 Tells light-hearted jokes and reacts to feedback

    📚 Provides fallback responses for unknown queries

This project is ideal for beginners looking to understand chatbot logic, event handling, DOM manipulation, and basic animations in web development.

Task 3
🎬 Movie Recommendation System

A simple, interactive web application built with Flask that helps users discover movies based on their favorite genres. The system provides personalized movie recommendations from a curated dataset, all within a modern, user-friendly interface.

🔧Features:

    🎯 Genre-Based Recommendations: Select one or more genres (Action, Sci-Fi, Thriller, Crime, Drama, Animation, Comedy, Family, Adventure, Romance) to receive a list of recommended movies.
    
    🎥 Curated Movie Dataset: The app uses a built-in dataset of popular and critically acclaimed movies, each tagged with genres and release years.
    
    ✨ Modern UI: Clean, responsive interface styled with Bootstrap for a pleasant user experience.
    
    ⚡ Instant Results: Recommendations are generated instantly based on your selected genres—no need to sign up or log in.
    
    🔄 Easy Reset: Clear your selections at any time to start a new search.
