 Tic-Tac-Toe AI (Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning)

Welcome to my browser-based **Tic-Tac-Toe game** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This isn't just your regular Tic-Tac-Toe â€” the AI opponent (O) is **unbeatable**, thanks to the **Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning**.


## ðŸŽ® How It Works

- **You play as X**, and the **AI plays as O**.
- The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm** with **Alpha-Beta Pruning** to determine the best possible move.
- The AI is designed to **never lose**, making it a perfect opponent.
